# ToDoList:-

In this project I had  created a dynamic to do list. It will take inputs and add items in your list and save the information with the help 
of mongoose by cerating database. Also it has a funtionality to Delete item when the checkbox in front of the list item is clicked.

#Alao It creates a to do list when a different address is added to the address.For ex. if the website is hosted locally then the address is
localhost://3000 but if we add localhost://3000/something then a new list namely something will get created.
